# Spark-Word-Count
The Apache Spark file containing the map-reduce code and the SQL Database code is spark_wc.py  

The Gutenberf file I chose is in gutenberg.py

Install SQL-Python-connector and MySQL on your computer with root as username and password as what you set it to

Replace Hidden-Password with the actual Password
